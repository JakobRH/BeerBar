# TODO - Deployment


Your git repository has GitLab Pages configured, which will serve all files under `/public`.

Per default, this directory contains the `plain` frontend choice and will be used by GitLab Pages. If you want to use
another frontend option, clear this directory and copy your build files from your selected frontend choice to this
directory. See `/frontend/README.md`
-`Deployment` for more infos.
